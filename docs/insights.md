# Key Insights - British Airways Customer Review Analysis 

This document summarizes insights from British Airways passenger reviews (2016–2023). The analysis draws from multiple metrics including Overall Rating, Seat Comfort, Food & Beverages, Entertainment, Cabin Staff Service, and Value for Money. Patterns across aircraft, geography, traveler type, and time reveal consistent themes in customer satisfaction.

### 1. Aircraft Performance Insights
- Larger, long haul aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, and A380 consistently outperform smaller Airbus narrow bodies like the A319, A321, and A320 who appear more frequently at the lower end of ratings for Overall, Food, Entertainment, and Seat Comfort.
- Ratings for long haul aircraft remain strong even as overall satisfaction declines in later years (2022–2023), reinforcing the stability of long haul experience compared to short haul operations.

### 2. Geographic & Country Insights
- The UK and U.S. are consistently the highest-volume review sources, providing a strong foundation for country level comparison.
- Many European and Asia-Pacific countries show mid-range satisfaction levels, while regions relying heavily on short haul routes tend to score lower across comfort, food, and value.

### 3. Key Time Periods

**Long-Term View (2016–2023)**
- Overall satisfaction gradually declines across the timeline, with 2023 showing the lowest average ratings across most metrics.
- Early years (2017–2019) show higher, more stable satisfaction, aligning with stronger aircraft performance and higher review volume.
- Seat Comfort, Food, and Entertainment ratings trend flat to declining over time, suggesting limited improvement in these areas.

**COVID Period (2020–2021)**
- Review volume drops, but ratings remain highly inflated, especially on long haul aircrafts, due to reduced passenger density, reduced route network, and a skew toward premium or long haul travelers.
- Food and entertainment show pronounced dips during COVID months, reflecting reduced onboard service offerings.

**2022–2023 Decline**
- 2022 shows a distinct mid year low in August with recovery towards December.
- 2023 begins and ends with lower satisfaction across all metrics, particularly in Entertainment (1.1) and Food (2.4).
- These declines suggest rising expectations, operational strain, or changes in BA’s performance post COVID.

### 4. Metrics Insights 
**Cabin Staff Service**
- Consistently one of the strongest performing categories across all years and aircraft types. Even as other metrics decline, cabin crew ratings remain relatively steady (3.0–3.5 range).

**Seat Comfort**
- Strongly tied to aircraft: A380, Boeing 777-200, and Boeing 787 lead (2.8–3.3), while narrow-bodies score lower (2.5–2.7).
- Seat Comfort mirrors trends in Overall Rating — declining slightly in later years, especially 2023.

**Food & Beverages**
- One of the weakest metrics overall (typically 1.7–2.8).
- Long haul aircraft again perform better, but still not strongly.
- Food dips notably in 2020 and 2021, reflecting reduced catering during COVID.

**Entertainment**
- The lowest rated category across all years, averaging around 1.4.
- Narrow body aircraft often score below 1, indicating lack of IFE (in-flight entertainment) systems on many short haul routes.

### 5. Traveler & Seat Type Insights

- Traveler type influences satisfaction: Business, Solo, Couple, and Family segments show varying expectations and patterns, though no segment fully counteracts aircraft level performance.
- Economy and First Class have similar average ratings, whereas Business and Premium Economy scored lower likely due to higher expectations.
- Seat type has a smaller impact on satisfaction compared to aircraft model, reinforcing that the aircraft itself shapes most of the customer experience.

### Overall Takeaways
- Aircraft type is the single strongest driver of customer satisfaction across all metrics.
- Service categories like Food, Entertainment, and Value consistently underperform, regardless of year or traveler type.
- COVID created inflated ratings due to skewed travel conditions, while 2023 marks a new low point in passenger sentiment.
- Regions with more long haul flights usually have higher ratings than areas served mostly by short haul, narrow body aircrafts.
- Despite declining ratings, cabin staff performance remains a consistent strength.
